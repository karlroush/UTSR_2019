## Description
The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Fossil Energy manages the Advanced Turbine Program, which strives to improve U.S. gas turbine technology for coal-based power plant applications with carbon capture and storage.

One of the key elements of the Advanced Turbine Program is the University Turbine System Research (UTSR) Program. UTSR offers a Gas Turbine Industrial Fellowship (GTIF) program to recruit qualified university research students. This fellowship brings highly trained student researchers from the university to industrial gas turbine design and manufacturing environments.

## Hybrid UAV
The purpose of this project was to examine the viability of a variable cycle engine within a given ISR (Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) mission profile. Essentially, the system includes a ducted fan allowing for optimum design of the propulsion system aerodynamics without sacrificing the aero performance of the compact fuel-to-electric system.


## Laser PIV system
The goal of this project is to repurpose the Quantel Qsmart Twins laser for use in a particle image velocimetry (PIV) system. This resulted in designing and building the system for <10% of quoted industry cost for later use in low speed turbulence testing.

## Drag Test Rig
The  goal  of  this  project  was  to rebuild  the  drag  test  rig  and  collect  data  from of  a  new  set  of  samples. This resulted in streamlined data collection of drag testing (65% time reduction).

## Titan T62-32 Generator Instrumentation
The goal of this project was to instrument the Titan T62 and run it with an attached generator

## NPSS Unit Conversion
The goal of this project was to take an example of one of the Common Development Models and convert it to allow for SI unit input/output. This resulted in the standardization of NPSS unit conversions for international use.
